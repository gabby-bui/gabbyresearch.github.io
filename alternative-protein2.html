                <div class="intro-section">
                    <p>This project started as a learning experience since I worked as an undergraduate research assistant, and one of my main goals is to better understand difference-in-differences (DiD) methodology through hands-on application. Rather than just reading about causal inference in textbooks, I wanted to see how these methods work with real data, real questions, and real challenges.</p>
                    
                    <p>During the early days of COVID-19 (which was about 6 years ago already, time flies crazily isn’t it?), we saw meat processing plants get shut down, supply chains disrupted, and suddenly everyone was talking about food security. Looking at the dataset that I’ve been working on, I started to wonder whether this global crisis might have shifted how investors viewed alternative protein companies, especially those fully committed to the space versus those with more diversified portfolios.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                
                <p>TThis analysis is part of my research assistantship with Khoa Anh Tran, a PhD candidate at INSEAD. Our broader project examines investment patterns in the alternative protein industry, and this particular analysis focuses on understanding whether COVID-19 represented a structural break in how investors approached different types of companies in this sector.</p>

                <p>The alternative protein industry includes companies developing plant-based meats, cultivated meat, fermentation-derived proteins, and other novel protein sources. Some companies specialize exclusively in these technologies (what we call "specialized firms"), while others maintain diversified portfolios that include both alternative proteins and other business lines (what we call "diversified firms"). This research question matters as when COVID-19 hit, traditional meat supply chains faced unprecedented disruptions, processing plants became COVID hotspots, and countries started worrying about protein supply security. We might think this would benefit all alternative protein companies equally, but there's also a reason to believe specialized firms could have benefited more.</p>

                <p>This question matters as when COVID-19 hit, traditional meat supply chains faced unprecedented disruptions.

You might think this would benefit all alternative protein companies equally, but there's reason to believe specialized firms could have benefited more.</p>
                
                <p>Specialized firms represent a pure play on alternative proteins. For investors convinced that COVID-19 revealed fundamental vulnerabilities in traditional protein systems, these companies offered the most direct way to bet on that thesis. Diversified firms, by contrast, might have seemed like a hedge or a safer option, but potentially less attractive if you really believed the pandemic was a game-changer for the industry. Hence, understanding whether this differential effect actually materialized has implications for how we think about crisis-driven investment patterns and whether major events can shift investor preferences toward more focused versus more diversified companies within an emerging sector.</p>

            <section id="dataset">
                <h2>Dataset</h2>
                
                <p>I compiled this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/sdd5sq80l0rv002os6v1w/All_Companies_Database.csv?rlkey=chodjs7k4aw5d0pxrs42j05xt&st=mit4e16c&dl=0">dataset</a> from multiple sources over several months of work. The primary data sources include the Good Food Institute's comprehensive database of alternative protein companies, DealRoom's venture capital records, Pitchbook's investment data, and patent databases for innovation metrics. The final dataset includes information on hundreds of alternative protein companies tracked across multiple years (2012-2023). For each company-year observation, I have data on whether they successfully raised venture capital funding that year, when they were founded, and whether they're classified as specialized or diversified. The data structure is panel data, which means that I observe the same companies across multiple time periods.</p>

                <p>I also made a deliberate choice to focus on companies founded in or before 2015 so that by 2020 (when COVID-19 hit), these companies had been operating for at least 5 years. This is because I believe newer companies might be raising funding on very different dynamics (seed rounds based on team and idea rather than traction), and including them could confuse the signal I'm trying to detect. Instead, I’m more trying to look at firms that had already proven some level of viability and were competing for growth capital, which makes the comparison cleaner.</p>

            <section id="setup">
                <h2>Setting up the analysis</h2>

                <p>Let me walk through the code step by step to explain what each part does and why I structured it this way, as well as what I learned about DiD implementation along the way.</p>
                
                <pre class="code-block"><span class="keyword">import</span> pandas <span class="keyword">as</span> pd
<span class="keyword">import</span> statsmodels.formula.api <span class="keyword">as</span> smf
<span class="keyword">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span class="keyword">as</span> plt</pre>

                <p>I use <code>Pandas</code> for reading the CSV, cleaning variables, and reshaping data. I also use <code>Statsmodels</code> to use the formula API that lets me specify models in R-style syntax (which I find more intuitive than building design matrices manually). Last but not least, I need <code>Mathplotlib</code> to do the visualization work.</p>
                
                <pre class="code-block"><span class="comment"># Upload data</span>
df = pd.read_csv(<span class="string">'../All_Companies_Database.csv'</span>)</pre>

                <p>This dataset lives one directory up from my Python script. When I first loaded it, I spent time with <code>df.head()</code>, <code>df.info()</code>, and <code>df.describe()</code> to understand what I was working with. The raw data had inconsistencies in how variables were recorded, which is why the cleaning functions below are so important.</p>

        <pre class="code-block"><span class="keyword">def</span> clean_year(y):
    <span class="keyword">try</span>: 
        <span class="keyword">return</span> int(y)
    <span class="keyword">except</span>: 
        <span class="keyword">return</span> None</pre>

        <p>In the raw data, founding years were sometimes recorded as strings, sometimes as integers, and sometimes missing or recorded as "-" or other placeholders. Hence, I set up the cleaning function which uses a try-except block because <code>int("-")</code> would throw an error. I wrap it in try-except so that any value that it can't be converted to an integer simply returns None (which pandas treats as missing) and it let me handle those cases consistently later.</p>
            
            <p>I learned this approach after initially trying to handle all the edge cases explicitly (checking for "-", checking for empty strings, etc.), which got messy quickly. The try-except approach is cleaner and more robust to unexpected data quirks.</p>

        <pre class="code-block"><span class="keyword">def</span> categorize_company_type(val):
    <span class="keyword">if</span> pd.isna(val) <span class="keyword">or</span> val == <span class="string">'-'</span>: 
        <span class="keyword">return</span> None
    <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="string">'Specialized'</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> val: 
        <span class="keyword">return</span> 1  <span class="comment"># Treatment group (Dummy = 1)</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="string">'Diversified'</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> val: 
        <span class="keyword">return</span> 0  <span class="comment"># Control group (Dummy = 0)</span></pre>

        <p> This treatment-control function is doing something conceptually important for the DiD analysis. I'm creating a binary variable where 1 represents specialized companies (my treatment group) and 0 represents diversified companies (my control group).</p>
            
            <p>A good question to ask is Why calling specialized firms the "treatment" group when COVID-19 affected everyone? To my understanding, in DiD terminology, "treatment" doesn't necessarily mean something was done to that group; rather, it means we expect them to be differentially affected by the event we're studying. I hypothesize that COVID-19 shifted investor preferences more toward specialized firms, so they're the treatment group even though the pandemic itself wasn't targeted at anyone specifically.</p>
            
            <p>I use <code>'Specialized' in val</code> rather than <code>val == 'Specialized'</code> because in the raw data, some entries were "Specialized - Plant-Based" or "Specialized - Fermentation", etc. The <code>in</code> operator catches all of these variations.</p>

        <pre class="code-block"><span class="keyword">def</span> clean_raised_yn(val):
    <span class="keyword">if</span> pd.isna(val): 
        <span class="keyword">return</span> None
    <span class="keyword">if</span> val == <span class="string">'Y'</span> <span class="keyword">or</span> val == <span class="string">'Yes'</span> <span class="keyword">or</span> val == 1: 
        <span class="keyword">return</span> 1

        <p>My dependent variable is whether a company raised funding in a given year. Different data sources recorded this in different ways as some used Y/N, some used Yes/No, some used 1/0. Therefore, this function harmonizes all of that into a clean binary variable where 1 means "raised funding" and 0 means "didn't raise funding". Then, I have the final <code>return None</code> as a safety net so that if a value doesn't match any of the expected patterns, I'd rather know about it (as a missing value) than silently misclassify it.</p>

        <pre class="code-block">df[<span class="string">'Year_founded_clean'</span>] = df[<span class="string">'Year founded'</span>].apply(clean_year)
df[<span class="string">'Company_Type_Dummy'</span>] = df[<span class="string">'Company type'</span>].apply(categorize_company_type)
df[<span class="string">'Raised_Binary'</span>] = df[<span class="string">'Raised_YN'</span>].apply(clean_raised_yn)</pre>

        <p>The <code>.apply()</code> method runs each cleaning function on every row of the corresponding column. I create new columns (with "_clean", "_Dummy", "_Binary" suffixes) rather than overwriting the original columns since during development, I often went back to check the original values when debugging, and having both versions made that much easier. In a final production version, I might drop the original columns, but for research work, I prefer to keep them.</p>

            <p><code>post</code>: This is 0 for all years before 2020 and 1 for 2020 and after. I chose 2020 as the cutoff because that's when COVID-19 became a global pandemic and started affecting business conditions. The <code>.astype(int)</code> converts the boolean result to 0s and 1s.</p>
            
            <p><code>treatment_post</code>: This is the interaction term, and it equals 1 only for specialized firms in the post-2020 period. I use this to estimate the DiD effect of how much more (or less) did specialized firms' funding probabilities change after COVID-19 compared to diversified firms.</p>

            <p>I'm using OLS (ordinary least squares) here even though my outcome is binary (0 or 1), or also known as a linear probability model. Some people prefer logit or probit for binary outcomes, but LPMs have advantages for causal inference since the coefficients are easier to interpret (they're percentage point changes in probability), and the parallel trends assumption is more transparent. The main downside is that predicted probabilities can go outside [0,1], but that's rarely a practical problem for DiD estimation where we care about the treatment effect coefficient, not the predictions themselves.</p>

Estimated treatment effect: 0.0211</pre>

        
            <p>The coefficient on treatment_post is 0.0211 with a p-value of 0.049. In plain language, this means that COVID-19 increased the probability of receiving funding for specialized alternative protein firms by about 2.11 percentage points relative to diversified firms. The p-value of 0.049 sits right at the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance, which I'll discuss more in the critical thinking section below.</p>

            <h3>Points to be critical about:</h3>
            
            <p>The p-value of 0.049 is technically below 0.05, but just barely, hence making me cautious. A p-value of 0.049 versus 0.051 doesn't represent a fundamental difference in the strength of evidence. What this tells me is that the effect is real but modest, and I shouldn't overstate the certainty of my findings. Also, a 2.11 percentage point increase might not sound like much, but the baseline funding probability for specialized firms pre-COVID was about 10% (intercept 0.0639 + treatment 0.0354). An additional 2.11 percentage points represents roughly a 20% relative increase, which is actually quite substantial in venture capital terms, where funding decisions are highly competitive.</p>
            
            <p>Interestingly, the treatment coefficient (0.0354) is actually larger than the DiD estimate (0.0211), which means that specialized firms were already performing better before COVID-19, and the pandemic widened that gap further. Therefore, my own intepretation is that COVID-19 might have accelerated an existing trend rather than creating a completely new dynamic. The post coefficient (0.0353) is almost identical to the treatment coefficient (0.0354) and larger than treatment_post (0.0211). This tells us that COVID-19 boosted funding for all alternative protein companies substantially, and the specialized firms got an extra boost (treatment_post), but the main story might be that the pandemic was good for the entire sector. Investors became more interested in alternative proteins across the board, with specialized firms benefiting somewhat more.</p>
            
            <p>Also, the R-squared of 0.010 means my model explains only 1% of the variation in funding outcomes. I believe this is fine for casual inference, as I'm not trying to predict who gets funding (which would require including tons of company-specific variables); instead, I'm trying to isolate one specific causal effect. The low R-squared just means that most of the variation in funding comes from other factors like company quality, team strength, market timing, and random chance. Therefore, my DiD estimate can still be valid and meaningful.</p>

            <img src="did-visualization.png" alt="Difference-in-Differences Visualization">
            <p class="visualization-caption">Figure 1: This visualization shows the classic DiD pattern. Before 2020, specialized firms (red line) had a higher funding probability than diversified firms (blue line), and both were relatively flat. After 2020, both lines jump upward (the parallel upward shift), but the red line jumps a bit more. That extra jump in the red line is the 2.11 percentage point DiD estimate.</p>
        </div>

        
            <h3>What does this mean in prarctice?</h3>
            
            <p>Imagine two alternative protein companies founded in 2015. Company A is specialized, focusing exclusively on plant-based meat. Company B is diversified, making plant-based products but also traditional food items. Before COVID-19, Company A had about a 10% chance each year of raising VC funding, while Company B had about a 6% chance. Then COVID-19 hits. For Company B, the probability jumps to about 10% (up 3.53 percentage points). For Company A, it jumps to about 15.6% (up 3.53 + 2.11 = 5.64 percentage points total). Both companies benefit from increased investor interest in alternative proteins, but the specialized company benefits more. Over multiple years and across many companies, this differential adds up. Specialized firms had better access to capital during and after the pandemic, potentially allowing them to scale faster, invest more in R&D, and capture market share while diversified competitors had less fuel for growth.</p>

                <h2>Testing the parallel trends assumption</h2>

        <p>The validity of any DiD analysis rests on the parallel trends assumption. In the absence of COVID-19, specialized and diversified firms would have continued on parallel trajectories. We can't directly test this (because we don't observe the counterfactual world where COVID didn't happen), but we can examine whether the trends were parallel before COVID-19 hit.</p>

        <p>I'm now running a regression of the outcome on treatment, time, and their interaction, using only pre-2020 data.

If it is significant, that suggests the groups were on different trajectories even before COVID-19, which would undermine the DiD identification strategy.</p>

            <h3>Interpreting the parallel test</h3>
            
            <p>The interaction term (treatment:time) has a coefficient of 0.0064 with a p-value of 0.049. This is borderline significant that suggests that the parallel trends assumption might be somewhat violated. Specialized firms' funding probabilities were growing about 0.64 percentage points faster per year than diversified firms' even before COVID-19. To me, this is tricky as if the pre-trends weren't perfectly parallel, then part of what I'm attributing to COVID-19's impact might actually just be a continuation of pre-existing trends. The DiD estimate might be biased upward (if specialized firms were already pulling ahead faster) or downward (if the pandemic interrupted an even steeper divergence).</p>
            
            <p>The plot shows both groups generally increasing over time, but with substantial year-to-year volatility. The formal test picks up on the fact that specialized firms' overall trajectory is steeper. However, there's no dramatic break or obvious divergence in the pre-period that would make me completely doubt the DiD design. Also, with a marginal p-value (0.049) and visual inspection showing reasonable (if not perfect) parallelism, I'm inclined to report the main DiD results but flag this as a limitation. The estimate of 0.0211 might be somewhat biased, but probably not egregiously so. If the pre-trends test had shown p < 0.01, I'd be much more concerned.</p>
            
            <p>That very large condition number (4.37e+06) is a technical issue related to how the year variable is coded (using actual years like 2015, 2016, etc. creates large numbers that can cause numerical precision problems). This doesn't invalidate the test, but it's a reminder that the standard errors might be somewhat unreliable. I could fix this by centering the time variable (subtracting, say, 2015 from all years), but for the purposes of this learning exercise, I'm leaving it as is while noting the limitation.</p>

                <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
            
            <p>Working through this analysis taught me that DiD is both simpler and more complex than it seems in textbooks. The basic intuition (compare the before-after change in treatment group to the before-after change in control group) is straightforward. But implementing it well requires making thoughtful decisions at every step. I also learned that data cleaning matters a lot. If I'd been sloppy about how I coded treatment status or the outcome variable, I could have gotten completely different results. Also, the parallel trends assumption is really important but also inherently untestable to me (we can only examine pre-treatment trends, not the counterfactual post-treatment trends). I learned that statistical significance isn't everything since effect sizes, confidence intervals, and substantive interpretation matter just as much. Most importantly, I learned that causal inference is as much about critical thinking as it is about running regressions. Every result needs to be interrogated. What are the alternative explanations? What are the limitations? What would change if I made different methodological choices?</p>
        

        <h3>The big picture</h3>

        <p>So what did I actually find? The evidence suggests COVID-19 did shift investor preferences toward specialized alternative protein companies, but the effect was modest and the evidence is not rock-solid. Specialized firms experienced about a 2 percentage point larger increase in funding probability compared to diversified firms, which is economically meaningful given the baseline probabilities, but this needs to be interpreted carefully given the marginal statistical significance and potential parallel trends violation.</p>

        <p>The broader pattern is clearer: COVID-19 boosted funding for the entire alternative protein sector. Both specialized and diversified firms benefited substantially. The pandemic seems to have served as a focusing event that heightened awareness of supply chain vulnerabilities and food system risks, making investors more receptive to alternative protein solutions generally.</p>

        <p>Whether specialized firms benefited even more than diversified firms remains somewhat uncertain given the methodological limitations, but there's suggestive evidence that they did. This makes sense given the logic: if COVID-19 made investors more convinced about the fundamental promise of alternative proteins, a pure play would be more attractive than a diversified company where alternative proteins are just one part of the business.</p>

        <h3>Limitations and Future Directions</h3>

        <p>This analysis has several important limitations that future work could address. First, the parallel trends assumption appears somewhat violated, with specialized firms already growing faster before COVID-19. Using alternative control groups or more sophisticated synthetic control methods might provide more robust estimates. Second, I haven't controlled for any company-specific characteristics beyond their founding year and specialization status. Companies differ in size, technology platform, geographic location, and many other factors that might affect both their pre-COVID trajectories and their post-COVID funding outcomes. Adding these controls could help isolate the true effect of COVID-19 more precisely. Third, my "treatment" cutoff of 2020 is somewhat arbitrary. COVID-19 emerged gradually over early 2020, and different regions were affected at different times. A more refined analysis might use variation in when different companies' local markets were hit by COVID disruptions, though this would require more detailed data. Fourth, I'm treating all post-2020 years as equivalent, but the pandemic's effects likely changed over time. An event study design that estimates separate effects for 2020, 2021, 2022, etc. would show whether the boost to specialized firms was immediate, delayed, temporary, or persistent. Finally, my outcome variable is simply whether companies raised funding (yes/no), not how much funding they raised or on what terms. Looking at funding amounts, valuations, or even patent filings and hiring as alternative outcomes could provide a richer picture of how COVID-19 affected these companies.</p>
