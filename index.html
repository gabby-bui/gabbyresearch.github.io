                <p>Hello! I'm Gabby Bui, a first-year Math major at Macalester College from the Central Highlands of Vietnam, where my family grows coffee (yes I love coffee!).</p>

                <p>I'm currently building a real-time sign language recognition system because my mom is deaf and uses Vietnamese Sign Language. This is my first independent technical project, and I'm learning computer vision and machine learning as I go. Eventually, I want to adapt this work for Vietnamese Sign Language, where accessibility tools barely exist.</p>

                <p>I also founded the Central Highlands Initiative, a peacebuilding program that bridges indigenous Ê-đê and Viet communities in my home region. Beyond that, I work as a research assistant analyzing policy impacts using causal inference methods and spent 10 months studying Mathematics & Economics with Nobel Laureate Eric Maskin during high school.</p>

                <p>I'm early in my research journey, but I'm passionate about using data science and machine learning to solve problems that matter to real people!</p>

                <p><strong>Currently working with:</strong> Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, MediaPipe</p>
